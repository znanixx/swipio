  <strong>Terms of Service</strong>
  <p>Last updated: 2026-02-24</p>
  <br>
  <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Swipio: Language Learning mobile
    application (the "Application"), provided by Vitalii Mykhailiuk (the "Service Provider") as a Freemium service.</p>
  <br>
  <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do
    not use the Application.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>1. Eligibility and Responsibility</strong>
  <p>The Application is intended for a general audience. By using the Application, you represent that you are permitted
    to use it under applicable law and that you have the legal capacity to accept these Terms.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you are under the age of majority where you live, you may use the Application only with the permission of a
    parent or legal guardian, and your parent or legal guardian is responsible for your use of the Application.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you are under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country to consent to data processing), you may use the
    Application only with a parent or legal guardian. For how we handle data, see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy
      Policy</a>.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>2. License and Restrictions</strong>
  <p>The Application (including all related trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property
    rights) remains the property of the Service Provider and/or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, translate,
    publish, distribute, sell, lease, sublicense, or otherwise exploit the Application (or any part of it), except as
    expressly permitted by applicable law.</p>
  <br>
  <p>You may not attempt to extract, derive, or discover the source code of the Application; create derivative works; or
    bypass or circumvent any technical measures designed to protect the Application.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>User Content.</strong> The Application may allow you to create or store content locally on your device
    (e.g.,
    custom flashcards). This content is for your personal use only and is not shared with the Service Provider
    or other users. You are solely responsible for the content you create and for maintaining backups of your data. The
    Service Provider is not responsible for any loss of data resulting from Application updates, device failure, or
    uninstallation.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>3. Changes to the Application and Pricing</strong>
  <p>The Service Provider aims to keep the Application useful and efficient and may update, change, suspend, or
    discontinue any part of the Application at any time. If any paid features are introduced or changed, the Service
    Provider will make pricing and payment terms clear to you before you are charged.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>4. Privacy and Device Security</strong>
  <p>The Application may store and process personal data you provide in order to deliver its functionality. You are
    responsible for securing your device and keeping access to the Application safe.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Any collection and processing of personal data is governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Service Provider strongly recommends that you do not jailbreak or root your device. Removing operating system
    restrictions can expose your device to malware and security risks and may cause the Application to malfunction or
    stop working entirely.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below
      are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <br>

  <strong>5. Paid Features, Subscriptions, and Trials</strong>
  <p>The Application may offer certain features as paid features (for example, premium content or functionality)
    ("Paid Features"). Paid Features may be offered as a one-time purchase and/or as an automatically renewing
    subscription ("Subscription"). The available options, prices, billing period, and what is included in Paid Features
    are shown in the Application at the time of purchase.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Lifetime Purchase.</strong> If the Application offers a "Lifetime Purchase", it means access to the
    applicable Paid Features for the duration of the Application's commercial life (the period during which the Service
    Provider actively supports and distributes the Application). A Lifetime Purchase is not a promise that the
    Application or any Paid Features will remain available forever.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>As-is; changes and discontinuation.</strong> One-time purchases (including a Lifetime Purchase) are
    provided
    on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. You receive access to the Paid Features that are available at the time of
    purchase, but the Service Provider may change, remove, replace, or discontinue features or functionality at any time
    at its sole discretion. Where reasonably practicable, the Service Provider will provide notice of discontinuation.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Termination and obsolescence.</strong> Your Lifetime Purchase access and license will end if the Service
    Provider ceases operations, is declared bankrupt or insolvent, or otherwise stops making the Application available.
    In addition, access may end if technological changes outside the Service Provider's control (for example, major
    operating system updates, platform policy changes, or device hardware changes) make the Application or the relevant
    Paid Features obsolete, unavailable, or impracticable to maintain.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Account scope; non-transferable.</strong> A Lifetime Purchase is personal to you and non-transferable. It
    is
    tied to the store account credentials you used to purchase it (for example, your Apple ID or Google account) and
    cannot be transferred, assigned, shared, resold, or used by another person. To the extent permitted by applicable
    law, the Lifetime Purchase and the license granted to you under these Terms terminate upon your death.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Billing through Apple App Store / Google Play.</strong> Purchases and Subscriptions are processed by the
    app
    marketplace from which you downloaded the Application (for example, Apple App Store or Google Play). The Service
    Provider does not collect your full payment card details and cannot access or control your marketplace account.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Auto-renewal.</strong> If you purchase a Subscription, it will renew automatically unless you cancel it
    through your marketplace account settings before the end of the current billing period. Your marketplace account
    will be charged in accordance with the marketplace rules and the pricing shown at the time of purchase.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Renewal timing.</strong> Renewal charges and timing are determined by the marketplace rules. For example,
    on
    some platforms renewal may be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of the current billing period.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Trials and promotions.</strong> If a free trial or promotional access is offered, it will be subject to the
    terms displayed in the Application and the marketplace rules. Unless you cancel before the trial ends, a trial may
    convert into a paid Subscription and you may be charged by the marketplace.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Managing and cancelling.</strong> You can manage, cancel, or change your Subscription in your Apple App
    Store or Google Play account settings. Deleting the Application does not cancel your Subscription.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Price changes.</strong> Subscription prices may change for future periods. If the price changes, you will
    be
    notified by the marketplace, and the change will apply only in accordance with the marketplace rules (which may
    require your confirmation).</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> Refund requests are handled by the marketplace (Apple App Store or Google Play) under its
    refund policies and applicable law. Purchases are processed by the marketplace, and the Service Provider generally
    cannot issue refunds for those purchases.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>6. Internet Connection and Network Charges</strong>
  <p>Some features of the Application require an active internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). The Service Provider
    is not responsible if the Application does not function fully due to lack of connectivity or because you have used
    up your data allowance.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider's terms will apply. You may be
    charged by your mobile network provider for data usage (including roaming charges) or by other third parties. You
    are responsible for all such charges. If you are not the bill payer for the device, you confirm that you have the
    bill payer's permission to use the Application.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>7. Availability, Updates, and Termination</strong>
  <p>You are responsible for ensuring your device remains charged and operational. If your device runs out of battery
    and you cannot access the Application, the Service Provider is not responsible for resulting unavailability.</p>
  <br>
  <p>While the Service Provider makes reasonable efforts to keep the Application accurate and up to date, some
    information and functionality may depend on third parties. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service
    Provider is not liable for any direct or indirect loss arising from your reliance on information or functionality
    provided through the Application.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Service Provider does not guarantee uninterrupted availability of the Application, or that the Application will
    be error-free, secure, or available at any particular time or location.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Service Provider may update the Application from time to time. Continued use may require installing updates.
    The Service Provider does not guarantee that updates will always be available or that the Application will remain
    compatible with your device or operating system version.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Service Provider may stop providing the Application and may terminate your right to use it at any time without
    prior notice. Unless stated otherwise, upon termination: (a) the rights granted to you under these Terms end; and
    (b) you must stop using the Application and, if necessary, delete it from your device.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</strong>
  <p>The Application is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
    law, the Service Provider disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory,
    including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and
    any warranties arising from course of dealing or usage of trade.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Service Provider does not warrant that the Application will meet your requirements, that it will be accurate,
    complete, or reliable, that any defects will be corrected, or that the Application (or any servers or systems used
    to provide it) are free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>9. Limitation of Liability</strong>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service Provider will not be liable for any indirect,
    incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or
    goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Application, even if the Service
    Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
  <br>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Service Provider's total liability for any claims arising
    out of or related to the Application or these Terms will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for Paid Features
    in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or USD 0 if you made no
    payments.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain
    damages. In such jurisdictions, the Service Provider's liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by
    law.</p>
  <br>

  <strong>10. Governing Law; Disputes; Jurisdiction</strong>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, excluding its conflict-of-laws rules, unless mandatory
    consumer protection laws in your country of residence require otherwise.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting the Service Provider at
    support@znanixx.com and allowing a reasonable time to respond.</p>
  <br>
  <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Application
    will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Prague, Czech Republic.</p>
